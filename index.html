<h3>
The Problem</h3>

<p>Our task is to create a machine learning model that can predict which Major League Baseball player is most likely to get a hit in a day. We aim to use statistics from recent games as well as previous seasons to accomplish this. The output will be the likelihood of a hit for each batter on a given day against a given pitcher. We chose this task beause there is a fantasy game on MLB.com where if you can predict a hit for 57 days in a row, you will win $5.6 million. Our goal is to make a system where we can input the current day's games and matchups and we can predict which player is most likely to get a hit.

<h3>Our Solution</h3>

<p>
  When we started, we had many different ideas for possible features. To narrow it down, we tested most of the ideas. After many iterations, we narrowed it down to the following list:
    <ul>
    <li>Hitter season batting average</li>
    <li>Hitter batting average in last 20 plate appearances (indicator of hot/cold streak)</li>
    <li>Hitter plate appearances per game (full season)</li>
    <li>Home/away</li>
    <li>Ballpark factor (an adjustment for the hitter-friendliness of the ballpark)</li>
    <li>Opposing pitcher season ERA</li>
    <li>Opposing pitcher ERA in last two starts (indicator of hot/cold streak)</li>
    <li>Opposing pitcher season FIP (fielder-independent pitching)</li>
    <li>Opposing pitcher season Batting average against (BAA)</li>
    <li>Gametime temperature (research says that warmer weather is better for hitters)</li>
  </ul>
  When chooising a learner, we were limited by what type of output we needed. In order to choose the hitters most likely to suceed, we needed to output a percentage probability of sucess. The most common type of this is logistical regression.
